        <h2>The challenges of keeping the tradition alive</h2>
    <p>On a sweltering Friday afternoon, around 500 elderly people queue up for small packets of rice in Argyle Street Park Playground. The rice symbolises safety and health. The handouts mark the end of the annual Yu Lan, or Hungry Ghost Festival. </p>

<p> lt falls on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. Believers worship deities, commemorate ancestors and supposedly ‘help’ wandering ghosts.</p>

  <p>The Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community has been following this tradition for over 100 years. </p>

<p>“It is a festival for both humans and gods to enjoy themselves,” said Anven Wu, the organiser of the event for the Chiu Chow Community.</p>

<p>The festival is not only a religious custom but also an exemplification of Chinese traditional values, such as filial piety and helping the weak and forlorn.</p>

<p>The faithfuls pay respects to ancestors and offer food to hungry souls who roam the earth.</p>

<p>At the same time, deities from neighbouring community temples, symbolised by incense burners, are ‘invited’ to take part in the festival.

<p>The burners are placed on the altar for believers to offer joss sticks to the gods.</p>

<p>Each year, the month-long celebration across the city features the god’s play in different districts, a kind of Chinese opera that includes five playlets in Teochew dialect.</p>

<p>To give the gods the best view of the opera, the stage faces the altar. Five playlets are performed each day was a show of thanks to the deities.</p>

<p>“It costs about $12 million to organise a three-day-festival”, said the chairperson of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community. </p>

<p>“Since it is very challenging for us to raise money, the scale of the event has definitely dwindled over the years,” he added.</p>


<p>“Residents in Shau Kei Wan, an old fishing village, crowdfunded to organise celebratory activities for the birthdays of different gods in the past,” said Marianne Wong Pui-yin, Senior Tutor of the Department of Chinese and History at City University of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>“However, as the community developed, some of these obsolete traditional activities have fallen behind the times and people stopped organising them because fundraising became difficult,” Wong added.</p>

<p>“To preserve the culture, it is crucial to continue organising the activities so that people will not forget,” said Wong, “just like the Cheung Chau Bun Festival which is held every year.”</p>

<p>To cut cost, actors and musicians of the opera troupe stay in the backstage instead of renting hotel rooms. When the heat is unbearable, they even sleep under the stage.</p>

<p>“There is nothing we can do,” said Cai Zhuangrong, a flute player, “our boss doesn’t have a huge budget.”</p>

<p>“We used to have 50 people in the troupe,” Cai recalled, “now we only have around 30 left.”</p>

<p>“We have to cut down on everything because of the competition,” he explained. “There are over 30 troupes vying for this performance. We are grateful that we’ve got the job.”</p>

<p>Cai and many other performers joined the troupe when they were already middle-aged.</p>

<p>“I had to opt for a more stable and better-paid job when I was younger to provide of my family,” he said. </p>

<p>A Chinese Opera troupe member earns between 1500 and 2500 yuan ($1790 to $3000 Hong Kong dollars ) a month. That is 4000 yuan less than an average of a worker in urban areas, according to the Japan Times.</p>

<p>The organizing committee for the festival is also having trouble attracting new blood.</p>

<p>“Most young adults would not take on the responsibility,” Wu said. “Most of them merely copy what they saw their parents did in the past, and some won’t follow the customs at all.”</p>
 
<p>According to Wu, most of the committee members are in their 70s and 80s, while members in the New Territories chapters are, on average, 10 to 20 years younger.</p>

<p>Changing beliefs also hinders the passing down of traditions.

<p>In the old days, the festival was held to help villagers gain self-confidence by worshipping and receiving blessings from the deities, said Wu.</p>

<p>“The older generation did not have a definite religion, so they worshipped any god,“ said the organiser.</p>

<p>Wu explained that worshipping different deities at the festival, be it Buddhism or Taoism, was a form of folk religion when everybody wanted blessings.</p>

<p>But as the city becomes more affluent and many young people have religious beliefs, the festival no longer serves the same purposes.</p>

<p>Now, the festival is regarded as an occasion to commemorate ancestors.</p>

<p>Still, many in the city saw the festival as an occasion when ghosts gather at the gate to the underworld as it opens at the beginning of the seventh month of the Lunar calendar.</p>

<p>For example, according to the organiser of the Hungry Ghost Festival, Yama, the king of hell in charge of the punishment of souls, would allow the tortured ghosts to visit the earth during the Ghost month, according to mythology.</p>
 
<p>Believers would not roam the streets alone and or swim at night during this month to avoid bumping into roving spirits.</p>

<p>However, Wu explained that there are strict rules in the underworld. Wandering hungry ghosts are supposedly so thankful for the offerings that they would not cause trouble on earth.</p>

<p>These misunderstood taboos have made many people from the younger generation to be avoiding the festival, said Wu.

<p>Wu also believes that the insufficient organisation between different departments and limited venues support in the society contributes to the diminishing tradition.</p>

<p>“We no longer use bamboo scaffolds,” he explained, “the Leisure and Cultural Services Department said we need to use metal frames to avoid from damaging the sports ground.”</p>


<p>Traditions might not go parallel with laws nowadays, so the government is in a difficult position when balancing the dilemma, according to Marianne Wong from the City University, Department of Chinese and History. </p>

<p>In 2011, the Yu Lan Ghost Festival of the Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community was listed as an intangible cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The government has since taken steps to preserve the culture, for example, by promoting the festival on the Tourism Board’s website and meeting representatives to discuss how to preserve the culture.</p>

<p>Wong also said the government has little responsibility in preserving the culture as it has long been a tradition driven by indigenous people.</p>

    <h2> How Chinese treats hungry ghosts </h2>

    <p>Commonly known as the Chinese Halloween, the Hungry Ghost Festival falls on the 14th of the seventh lunar month. This year, a Chinese community organisation held the third Hungry Ghost Festival exhibition in Victoria Park from 1 to 3 September.</p>

        "Big Road" has the following key features:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>HTML only</strong> -- Actually, you don't need to learn HTML. Just get the code of current page and modify it.
        </li>
        <li>Sensible default style.</li>
        <li>Common elements:
            <code>p, em, strong</code>
        </li>
        <li>Snippet for responsive embedding of interactive charts, via <code>iframe</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Getting started </h2>

    <p>Make your first web story in three steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fork this repository</li>
        <li>Modify <code>index.html</code> to include your content</li>
        <li>
            Your web story is available on <code>username.github.io/big-road/</code>. For example this current page is available at <a href="hupili.github.io/big-road/">hupili.github.io/big-road/</a>. Checkout
            <a href="https://github.com/hupili/python-for-data-and-media-communication-gitbook/blob/master/notes-week-00.md#github-pages">this page</a> for more information about hosting on GitHub Pages.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Demo of supported elements for your article</h2>

    <p>
        You have already seen headings (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>), listings (<code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code>), and paragraph (<code>p</code>) in previous codes. In this section, we show you several other useful
        elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Highlight texts in a paragraph</h3>

    <p>
        In a pragraph, there may be some key information that you want to highlight. In HTML, we have two basic semantic tags for this purpose. You can <em>emphasize something</em> , or <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong>. The difference here
        is subtle and the choice depends on the author.
    </p>

    <h3>Image with caption</h3>

    <figure>
        <img src="images/class-demo.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
            <em> How "Big Road" looks like on mobile phone.</em>
            <br> Source: screenshot
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
        <img src="images/screenshot-demo.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
            Sometimes, the caption can be very long which is a standalone story by itself. So you don't have to put the entire block into emphasis mode. Just <em>emaphsize the part you find most important</em>.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Note, an image aspect ratio of 16:9 is recommended as a sensible default.</p>

    <h3>Responsive video embedding</h3>

    <p>Embedding videos in a responsive manner is always a pain. The conventional technique is to embed by <code>iframe</code>. You need to specify the width and height of the iframe, making it non-responsive to different screens.</p>

    <p>Use Youtube as an example. You can copy the following code of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4">this video</a> from its "Share --> Embed" button:
    </p>

    <p><code>
        &#x3C;iframe width=&#x22;560&#x22; height=&#x22;315&#x22; src=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4&#x22; frameborder=&#x22;0&#x22; allow=&#x22;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#x22; allowfullscreen&#x3E;&#x3C;/iframe&#x3E;
    </code></p>

    <!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->

    <p>The default result is as follows:</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="images/responsive-embedding-video.png" alt="">
        <figcaption>
            Default iframe embedding is not responsive to the screen width. It is either too small or too big.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        Following is one responsive video. You can check the source code of this page to see how it works. You don't have to completely understand the internal works. Simply subsituting the URL suffices.
    </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>

    <h3>Responsive interactive chart</h3>

    <p>With the wide spread tools today, you don't have to learn frontend technology in order to make interactive charts. For example, there are off-the-shelf online tools like
        <a href="https://infogram.com/">infogram.com</a>,
        <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">datawrapper</a>, and
        <a href="https://flourish.studio/">flourish</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are Python developer, libraries like <code>plotly</code>, <code>pyecharts</code>, <code>bokeh</code>, and <code>folium</code> can help you generate interactive charts and maps within Python environment. Next question is how to embed those
        interactive charts into your final work.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing is to use your chosen library/ online tool to export a standalone webpage that includes your chart. The webpage may come along with other auxiliary files like Javascript and CSS. You need to put those files all in one folder. Then use
        your browser to visit the webpage and make sure the chart looks normal as a standalone project. After that, ou can apply the same technique used from above responsive Youtube video to embed it into your web story Just use the following code block
        and replace the "src" attribute with the right path to your stand alone interactive chart.
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>&#x3C;responsive-block&#x3E;&#x3C;iframe src=&#x27;//server-name/path/to/the/file.html&#x27; frameborder=&#x27;0&#x27; allowfullscreen&#x3E;&#x3C;/iframe&#x3E;&#x3C;/responsive-block&#x3E;</code>
    </p>

    <p> Here is an example of a map made from Python's <code>folium</code> library. It is the original hi-fi version of the raster image used in <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aFfa7WlyT0vwXBlDYvacCg">this blog post</a>. Although the following one is
        not interactive or animated, you can easily make it so from the <code>folium</code> library. </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='charts/openrice-sichuan-food/map.html' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>

    <p>
        Following is an animated and interactive map of Sichuan's earthquake in past 100 years. It is made by D3. The project includes many auxiliary files to make the chart work. We'd like to show you that the responsive block works with not only charts on your
        local disk, but also charts (more precisely HTML pages) from the Internet. Note, in the "src" attribute, <strong>please start your URL with "//"</strong>, not "http", or "https". This notation lets the browser determine which protocol
        to use and improves compatibility.
    </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>

    <p>
        Note that the default aspect ratio is 16:9. Sometimes, 1:1 may look better on a vertical screen. Or, you can try 4:3, whose code is available in HTML comment block. Other aspect ratios are not suggested since this is a starter's template.
    </p>

    <ratio-1-to-1>
        <responsive-block>
            <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
        </responsive-block>
    </ratio-1-to-1>

    <!-- 
    <ratio-4-to-3>
        <responsive-block>
            <iframe src='//hupili.net/20170800-sichuan-earthquake-in-100years/' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
            </iframe>
        </responsive-block>
    </ratio-4-to-3>

    <h2>This page on desktop?</h2>

    <p>It does not use up the entire space on a desktop computer. However it is still readable. Now that 80% traffic is on mobile web, this should suffice for most web stories. Also note that, you just learned HTML 10 minutes ago and this is what you can
        make.
